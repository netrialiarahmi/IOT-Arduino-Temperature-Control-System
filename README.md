# IOT-Temperature-Monitoring-Device
This project uses a temperature sensor and a relay module to control a heater device. When the temperature drops below the set threshold, the relay will be activated and turn on the heater. When the temperature reaches the set threshold, the relay will be turned off and the heater will be turned off.
